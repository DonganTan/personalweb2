Political science research is very different from popular discussions about politics. Instead of partisan, philosophical, or ideological arguments, political scientists are interested in conducting research that seeks to explain the mechanics of how politics works. This course provides an introduction to research design and quantitative data analysis, key components of scientific research on political phenomena. Research design involves posing proper research questions, theory construction, hypothesis formulation, and issues of causality. The course will also introduce the machinery by which social science research is typically conducted: statistics. The material covered in this course is about making compelling, systematic arguments with empirical evidence and data. Statistical analysis has become an essential skill in business, campaigns, policy analysis, journalism, and academia. In this respect, the course can also provide a skillset that is quite valuable in the real world.
